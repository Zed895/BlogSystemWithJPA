# BlogSystemWithJPA
This is a simple blogsystem in Java, SpringBoot.
I created this hobby project to practice what I learnt on the Java course at sanfranciscoboljottem.com.
The stories are stored in H2 and PostgreSQL databases.
Search functions for stories based on title or blogger name are implemented in this first version.
Used technologies: Java, Maven, Spring Boot, JPA, hibernate, H2 and PostgreSQL databases.
